                        <h2 style="font-weight:bold">How to Manage Time?</h2>
                    <p><h5>Time is such a valuable aspect of our lives. It does not speed up for the rich or slow down for the poor. Time cannot be controlled or stored. So when you have multiple things in your mind, how can you do it all? Here are a few tips to do so</h5></p>
                    <p><h5>Set up your goals. These can be short-term or long-term goals. This step is essential if you want to work in an organized fashion. Avoid thinking about another work when you are already doing one. Learn to prioritize your work and take one step at a time. If you try to do multiple activities simultaneously, the chances of failure increase.</h5></p>
                   <br />
                   <h2 style="font-weight:bold">Identify your most important tasks</h2>
                    <p><h5>Identify the 2 or 3 most important tasks on your list and focus on getting those done first. Everything else on the list is secondary – it would be nice to get to, but don’t stress if there’s no time. They serve more as reminders of unimportant things you’ll have to get done eventually.</h5></p>
                   <br />
                   <h2 style="font-weight:bold">Create a DONE list</h2>
                    <p><h5>Simply put, the DONE list is a list of what you’ve accomplished during the day. It can be a simple collection of notes where you write down everything from sending out work emails to doing your laundry. Or you can subcategorize the DONE list by adding symbols and sorting the tasks into different areas of your life.</h5></p>
                   
                    <br />
                    <h2 style="font-weight:bold">To do lists or not to do lists?</h2>
                    <p><h5>Writing or typing down everything you need to get done can help you remember and plan your days, but only if you’re strategic in the way you create your to-do lists. Don’t bombard yourself with every little detail. Take your time to figure out which to-do list technique makes you the most productive.</h5></p>
                   <p><h5>Maybe you have your own way of organizing your tasks and priorities? Let us know in the comment section below!</h5></p>
                    <br />
                    <h2 style="font-weight:bold">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p><h5>There is no stressing out on the value of time in our lives. Efficient time management is the path to success. The easiest method of achieving this is to invest in time rather than spending it carelessly.</h5></p>
              <p><h5>A man who understands the power of time and learns to use it wisely cannot be defeated. Thus, management of time can be your greatest asset to success. Thus, just knowing the importance of time management is not sufficient. You must act to make a change. Every hour, minute, and second of our life counts. It is upon you how to manage time judiciously.</h5></p>
